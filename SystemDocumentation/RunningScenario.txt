PROJECT TITLE: CS994_CW

Game Overview: To complete the game, the user must obtain the "Diamond" object. This object is located in the FightArea, which can only be accessed 
by defeating a Troll who guards the area. The Troll itself can be beaten in two ways:

1) It can instantly defeated by a player who holds both a Sword and a Shield. These items are themselves
located within the PuzzleArea and GameArea respectively - each of these areas in turn also require the user to fulfill a task before being granted access.     
2) It can be defeated by a player who holds only a Sword, provided that they use a Health Potion should they take any damage. The Health Potion is located
in the LockedArea, which requires a Key object to unlock.

Due to the random nature of the GameArea, the Running Scenario will show how the game can be won using the second approach.



Running Scenario: Upon starting the game, the gameboard will be populated by several pre-determined areas (PuzzleArea, GameArea, FightArea, EmptyArea, LockedArea). 
The running scenario will only show the player traversing & interacting with the required area/entities (as mentioned above) to successfully complete the game. This will roughly be as follows:

Start Game --> 
	       Move to PuzzleArea --> Complete Puzzle --> Get Sword --> 
								        Find Key --> Unlock LockedArea --> Get HealthPotion -->
															        Move to FightArea --> Fight Troll Once --> Use Health Potion --> Fight Troll Again/Defeat Troll --> Get Diamond --> WIN GAME!
